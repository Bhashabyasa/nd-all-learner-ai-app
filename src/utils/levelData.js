Birds and animals might eat it by mistake and get sick. It also pollutes the ocean.\nFriend: Oh no! I didn’t realize it was that bad.\nLilly: That’s why we should always throw our trash in a dustbin. Let us keep our surroundings clean.\nFriend: You’re right, Lilly. Let’s pick it up and throw it in the bin.\nLilly: Great!
